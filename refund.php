                                On cancellation of refundable booking the refund processing will take time between
                                two(2)-to four(4) weeks to show refund back on your credit card statement. Reasons for
                                the specified processing time are based on billing cycle of your credit card company and
                                processing time of the bank. The refund depends on numerous factors such as the hotel's
                                cancellation policy, time of cancellation and processing fees etc. For more details
                                refer to the cancellation policy mentioned above.

                            <p>In case the reservation is not confirmed, we will not charge you anything on your credit
                                card and release the whole amount if any that was held on it immediately. Now after we
                                do this, it will still take two(2) to four(4) weeks for the bank to process the refund
                                and to show the refunded amount on your credit card.</p>
